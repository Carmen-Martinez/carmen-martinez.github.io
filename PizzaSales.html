            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>   
                The pizza industry, with its roots tracing back to Naples, Italy, has burgeoned into a global phenomenon. Offering a diverse array of flavors and toppings, 
                pizza has become a ubiquitous choice for fast and convenient meals, favored by individuals and families alike. This industry boasts a significant market size,
                with renowned chains such as Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut competing alongside local pizzerias and frozen pizza brands. Innovation thrives within this competitive 
                landscape, with a constant push towards meeting changing dietary preferences and technological advancements. From gluten-free options to plant-based toppings, the 
                pizza industry adapts to cater to a wide range of consumer needs. Beyond its culinary significance, pizza holds a special place in popular culture, appearing in 
                various forms of media and embodying the spirit of gatherings and celebrations. Through its enduring popularity and continuous evolution, pizza remains a beloved 
                staple in the global food landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                For these reasons, we will analyze pizza sales performance, identify trends, and offer key insights for business strategies. I'll walk you through the project from 
                start to finish, detailing the steps taken for this analysis, including data cleaning in SQL, exploratory data analysis in Python, and data visualization in Tableau.                
            </p>

            <h3>Data Information</h3>
                <p>Here is a snippet of the data we will be working with:</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/Pizza-Images/pizza_sales_table.PNG" style="width:50%"></img>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>columns + datatypes</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/Pizza-Images/data_info.PNG" style="width:20%"></img>
                </div>
                <p>At first glance, we can see some columns do not have the correct datatypes such as the order_time and order_date, both listed as a text datatype. 
                    We will correct these errors during the data cleaning process as it is important to get these fixed before we analyze our data
                </p>

            <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
                <p>Data cleaning is an important part of any data analysis project because dirty data is not workable. There are various steps and tools to cleaning data and depending on your dataset only some or all will be utilized</p>
                <ul>Non-exhaustive list on data cleaning steps:</ul>
                <li>Finding and removing duplicate rows</li>
                <li>Standardization</li>
                <li>Removing or adding missing/null data</li>
                <li>Deleting redundant or unnecessary columns</li>
                <br>
            <h4>Finding/removing Duplicates</h4>
                <p>
                    Let's get going! Our initial step is to pinpoint all those delightful duplicates. To do this, I've consolidated the order_id and pizza_name_id to create a unique identifier. 
                    Subsequently, I filtered out only those unique identifiers that appeared more than once. Fortunately, we didn't encounter any duplicate unique identifiers, saving 
                    us some time.
